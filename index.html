      Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of
      granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the
      tranquility of the High Sierra. First protected in 1864, Yosemite National
      Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square
      miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a
      vast wilderness area, and much more.

      Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully
      and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides
      updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for
